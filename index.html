      <h1>┃ My Profile!</h1>
      <p>
        ♢ I’m an 18-year-old backend developer who enjoys turning ideas into working software. I build systems, create games, and work on web projects that balance performance with creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep my style simple — write clean code, solve problems, and make sure things actually run the way they should. Always learning, always improving, and always up for building something new.

        <summary>╵ What languages do you use?</summary>
            <p>♢ I work with C, C++, and Python — still leveling up in all of them.  
            Right now, I’m learning JavaScript for backend web development.  
            Once I’m solid with that, I plan on diving into Rust, and Go to go deeper :D.

        <summary>╵ What kind of games/software have you made?</summary>
